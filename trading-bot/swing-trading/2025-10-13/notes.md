2025-10-16: TIAAY gapped up, so the best entry would have been 5.85 not the setup price which was 5.69.  

VBTX aquired by HBAN  
> HBAN closed at $15.50 so with the 1.95 conversion rate that comes out to $30.225 for VBTX which is very close to where VBTX closed today. Merger Arb folks keep that stuff in line.
