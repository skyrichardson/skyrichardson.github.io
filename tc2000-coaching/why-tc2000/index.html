      <h1 class="m-3">Why TC2000?</h1>



<p>Telechart has long been one of my favorite tools, I have been a Platinum service subscriber for over 18 years and find the latest release v18.x to be another great step forward. Endlessly customizable and scalable, the platform offers everything an investor in stocks, exchange-traded funds and options would need.</p>
<p>TC2000 was a winner in our <a href="https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/top-10-best-stock-market-analysis-software-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="img-responsive">Best Stock Market Analysis Software Review,</a> beating 25 other competitors.</p>
<h3>Pricing and Software &ndash; 10/10</h3>
<p>TC2000 is competitive on pricing with all premium stock market analysis software vendors, in fact, it is a leader in pricing, with only TradingView offering a similar price point. TC2000 has been voted as best software for 25 years straight by the readers of <a href="https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/top-7-best-investment-magazines-review-print/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technical Analysis of Stocks &amp; Commodities Magazine.</a></p>
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.tc2000.com/CMS_Static/Uploads/6E7A586D453831/LibScreen0-1.jpg" data-src="/CMS_Static/Uploads/6E7A586D453831/LibScreen0-1.jpg" /><small class="smallText text-center">2019 Pricing For TC2000 Services</small></p>
<p>Worden Brothers continue their winning ways, with very competitive pricing starting at only $9.99 per month for the Silver package. I would recommend the Gold service to start with as you get a more powerful alerts engine and unlock the huge power of the technical &amp; fundamental scanning and filtering that TC2000 is famous for.</p>
<p>TC2000 is aimed squarely at those trading stocks, ETF&rsquo;s, mutual funds and stock options, specifically on the U.S.A and Canadian Markets.</p>
<h3>TC2000 Trading Platform</h3>
<p>As I have been using the software since 1999 I can say the software is first class and reliable.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">TC2000 for Windows</h3>
<p>Developed with Microsoft&rsquo;s Dot.net framework TC2000 runs natively on the PC. It is fast, responsive and simple to use. The resolution of the software enables very intricate design details that other development platforms cannot match. Very quick to download and installation is a breeze.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">TC2000 for Mac</h3>
<p>Because TC2000 is developed on a Microsoft framework, you will need to install Parallels Desktop, a windows emulation software to be able to run TC2000. The current license cost for Parallels is $79.99.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">TC2000 for Mobile</h3>
<p>Worden Brothers have apps on both the Apple store and the Google Play store, as you can imagine due to screen real-estate some of the functionality is trimmed.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">TC2000 Support &amp; Customer Service</h3>
<p>Support is excellent both on the forums, via email or via the phone. When you call you will get straight through and are able to speak with skilled personnel in the U.S. I have never had an issue where it was not solved more or less immediately.</p>
<p>If you have not selected a Brokerage, you should look at <a href="https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/tc2000-brokerage-stock-broker-review-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="img-responsive">TC2000 Brokerage</a> as an option, they have competitive rates which also means you get full integration so you can trade stocks &amp; options directly from your charts, a huge bonus.</p>
<p>If you trade U.S. Stocks, ETF&rsquo;s or Mutual Funds, then this is a great solution. Worden also provides regular live training seminars which are of a very high quality and also tour the U.S.A with free live training seminars for subscribers.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">TC2000 Training &amp; Education</h3>
<p>The Worden Brothers in-house training team have hundreds of video webinars online available instantly. But even better than that they seem to be on a more or less constant roadshow with live free seminars across the United States. One of my students recently wrote to me telling me how great the training was and how much she learned. If you are based in the U.S. or can travel, it is well worth attending one of the scheduled seminars.</p>
<h3>Trade Management &ndash; 9/10</h3>
<p>Worden recently released <a href="https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/tc2000-brokerage-stock-broker-review-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="img-responsive">TC2000 Brokerage</a> offering discount brokerage services at $4.95 per trade. This new service means a tight integration between the charting software and the brokerage house.</p>
<p>Essentially it means the holy grail, trading directly from charts in a visual way.</p>
<p>Worden Brothers make a clean sweep 10/10 when it comes to trade management, with full Broker Integration (as long as you choose them as your broker).</p>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">24 Options Strategies instantly Available Via The Options Trading Menu.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Options Strategies</h3>
<p>Use the Options Trading button at the top of the chart to open Options Strategy tickets directly on the chart. The menu divides strategies into bullish, bearish and volatility categories. Strategies include single-leg, multi-leg, and combinations of the underlying stock.</p>
<p>Multi-leg strategies then open as a single trading ticket on the chart.</p>
<p>TC2000 also offers a nice implementation of options trading and integration, you can scan and filter on a large number of options strategies and then execute and follow them directly from the charts.</p>
<p>Good profit &amp; loss tracking and reporting round off the package to be a well-implemented solution.</p>
<h3 class="introHeader">Opening An Iron Condor Option Trade With TC2000</h3>

<h3>Fundamental Scanning and Screening &ndash; 10/10</h3>
<p>Make no mistake about it, if you want fundamentals stock screeners in real-time layered with technical screens all integrated into live watch lists connected to your charts TC2000 is a power player.</p>
<p>I selected TC2000 as my tool of choice back in the year 1999 because it offered back then, simply the best implementation of fundamental scanning, filtering and sorting available on the market. 20 years later, they are still a leader in this section.</p>
<p>They offer a huge selection of fundamentals to choose from 192 to be exact, but even better than that, what makes it truly unique is the fact you can, with a few clicks, create your own indicators based on the fundamentals.</p>
<p>You can then overlay the indicators directly on the charts, which opens up a whole new world of technical and fundamental analysis. 10 out of 10 for TC2000 again.</p>
